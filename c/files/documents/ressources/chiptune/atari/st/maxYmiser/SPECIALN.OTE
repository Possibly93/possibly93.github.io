In  the  case  that  your buzzer sounds
are  not  as  expected  -  in  this new
version  you  have  to  have a non-zero
volume sequence.

Just  change  your  volume  sequence to
a  single  step $000F sequence, and all
will be ok!

This  change  was  necessary  to  allow
track  volume  MIDI controllers to work
logically with buzzer sounds.
