                      Its thickness varies, and the world outside passes by in fluid, undulating waves. 
                      
                      In the cracks of this glass, where a forgotten autumn's chore may have left 
                      
                      its mark, can be seen all the colors of the rainbow, refracted splendidly for 
                      
                      anyone given to close inspection. Glued to a rippled pane, a fine rubber skink 
                      
                      watches a small cricket climb up the yellowed edge of an old skyharp postcard. 
                      
                      Through the Victorian crystal teardrops and hanging stained glass spheres, through 
                      
                      the pinned-up templates and photos and chipped green paint of the window's dusty 
                      
                      sash flows the orange evening sunlight, wavy after passing through the magic 
                      
                      window-lens. A breeze comes now and gently swings the antique glass balls, their 
                      
                      projected optical flares rocking back and forth upon circuit drawings, colored-light 
                      
                      fairies on a rippled orange sea.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The plans, today, upon which the fairies dance 
                      
                      are those of the circuit-bent Casio SK-1. ("Circuit-bending" refers 
                      
                      to the process of creative short-circuiting by which standard audio electronics 
                      
                      are radically modified to produce unique experimental instruments. A further 
                      
                      description of these techniques can be read in EMI Volume VIII #1, 1992.) Readers 
                      
                      of this article series have inquired over the years about the viability of keyboard 
                      
                      instruments as a focus for circuit-bending. While I'm inclined to think the 
                      
                      end result of the bending process is often better suited to less linear sound 
                      
                      machines, keyboards were an early target of mine, and the circuit-bent SK-1 
                      
                      is an exceptional example of deep-end anti-theory application combined with 
                      
                      equal-tempered polyphony. Abstract sound fields thick and intriguing, complex 
                      
                      voices, split keyboards, strange tone shaping and extended ADSR envelopes begin

                      individuals than any other sampler to date. The SK-1 began to appear on store 
                      
                      shelves in 1986. For its time, at its price and with its functions, there was 
                      
                      nothing else like it. Main features of this 32-note mid-size keyboard include:</font></p>

                      waiting to be reborn through circuit-bending. Since the resultant instrument

                      anti-theory transformation.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">My first SK-1 was bought during its heyday at a 
                      
                      price of around $90. I quickly made two modifications and, until lately, thought 
                      
                      no further about altering it. These early changes resulted in two jacks being 
                      
                      mounted on the SK-1's case. One was wired so that it would accept a remote sampling 
                      
                      trigger to use in conjunction with an external microphone. The other jack was 
                      
                      wired to accept programmed voltage pulses (such as those generated by drum machines) 
                      
                      so as to trigger the "one key play" function thereby turning the SK-1's 
                      
                      note memory into a nicely controlled sequencer. Push "start" on the 
                      
                      drum machine and both it and the SK-1 perform in tight synch. Fun.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Years pass... the SK-1 is overshadowed by industry 
                      
                      changes and pushed to the back of the shelf (go take out those batteries!). 
                      
                      Few things tend to encourage a circuit-bending experiment more than finding 
                      
                      a promising target device at a bargain price. Especially if the device is a 
                      
                      duplicate of an item you already own and care for, and is one you'd like to 
                      
                      bend but are hesitant for fear of damaging it in the process. So I was thrilled 
                      
                      to recently find a SK-1 (with a key missing) for only $1.50 at a thrift shop. 
                      
                      Oddly, several days later I found another SK-1, this time in great shape and 
                      
                      costing $5.00 at a different second-hand shop. The one with the missing key 
                      
                      became my prototype, the $5.00 unit became the finished instrument and my original 
                      
                      SK-1 remains as it was before.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Following the usual process of circuit-bending, 
                      
                      the instrument was expanded upon to the degree of now providing 28 new controls 
                      
                      (switches, dials and body-contacts), 7 micro green &amp; red LED logic pilots 
                      
                      and an ultra-bright sound envelope LED... 36 modifications. With all the added 
                      
                      controls turned off, the SK-1 operates as normal. The modifications are easy 
                      
                      to find and are open to anyone familiar with the use of a soldering pencil (small, 
                      
                      low-wattage soldering iron).</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Once again, the creative short-circuit is on the 
                      
                      loose, the repercussions of its catalytic anti-theory wreaking indeterminate 
                      
                      digital havoc within the all-too-proper halls of previously strict program logic. 
                      
                      The new controls were discovered one of two ways. Either by listening to the 
                      
                      instrument's voices while 1) using a wire to momentarily connect arbitrary circuit 
                      
                      board points to each other (this giving rise to 20 of the 22 circuit-bending 
                      
                      switches, their purpose being to implement and combine the creative short-circuits 
                      
                      just found), or 2) using fingertips to connect arbitrary circuit points to each 
                      
                      other (the 3 body-contacts and 2 of the 3 dials [potentiometers or pots, variable 
                      
                      resistors] were found in such a way).</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">This last activity, touching an active circuit-board 
                      
                      with the fingers to hear what changes occur in the sound, should be done only 
                      
                      with low-voltage, battery-powered circuitry. Circuits containing large capacitors 
                      
                      or step-up transformers are to be avoided. These are simple to recognize; check 
                      
                      out a beginner's electronic Project book if unfamiliar. These components usually 
                      
                      appear in various types of lighting circuits, practically never in the audio 
                      
                      electronics appropriate for circuit-bending. At any rate, the idea is that interesting 
                      
                      sounds arising from finger contact can be hard-wired into existence by soldering 
                      
                      a pot (variable resistor) between the two points so discovered. The middle solder 
                      
                      lug of the pot is wired to one circuit point, an outside lug of the pot to the 
                      
                      other circuit point. After all, that's exactly what your body is doing in the 
                      
                      same situation. As the electrical energy is conducted through your flesh its 
                      
                      potential changes as you vary the resistance presented it by adjusting the pressure 
                      
                      of your fingertips on the circuit-board. You've become, in essence, a variable 
                      
                      human resistor (aren't we all?). Conductivity will differ from individual to 
                      
                      individual, so there is no exact recommendation I can give as to the resistance 
                      
                      rating of the pot. Experiments with a 500K will provide a good starting point.</font></p>

                      9 sections. These are the IMAGE GROUP of 9 switches, the SKEW GROUP of 7 switches

                      explanations of these new circuit-bending discoveries, as well as guidelines

                    <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><strong><font color="#CCCCFF">TWO NOTES OF CAUTION</font><br>
                      </strong>1) Though it seems I haven't harmed any normal functions of my 3 SK-1s, 
                      
                      there's no guarantee that a connection I didn't try exists that could damage 
                      
                      or destroy the circuit. In the same vein, manufacturer's design changes can 
                      
                      create a situation in which a previously trusted circuit-bending connection 
                      
                      becomes either inoperative or destructive on a later model. Therefore, while 
                      
                      my instructions are valid in pertaining to my SK-1s, they may not be advisable 
                      
                      for yours.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">2) The bending procedure requires a great deal 
                      
                      of soldering tiny wires to very closely spaced IC pins protruding through the 
                      
                      underside of the board. Very careful connections need to be made in order to 
                      
                      avoid creating solder bridges between the pins. Quick connections are also a 
                      
                      good idea so as not to overheat the internal IC electronics connected to the 
                      
                      pin. I use a 30-watt grounded soldering station with long, tapered, 1/16" 
                      
                      wide chisel-tip on the soldering pencil. For point-to-point connections I use 
                      
                      insulated bought-in-quantity 30-gauge "wire-wrap" wire, the wilder 
                      
                      color the better, and lead-free silver electronic solder.</font></p>

                      OF THE CIRCUIT-BENDING EFFECT GROUPS</strong></font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">For persons interested in experimenting on their 
                      
                      own SK-1s, my descriptions below assume the working orientation of circuit is 
                      
                      such that the underside of the board faces the experimenter and that the parallel 
                      
                      grouping of three large (28 pin) ICs is to the bottom left (on reverse of board). 
                      
                      In this position a medium-sized electrolytic capacitor is situated at the top 
                      
                      right corner of the circuit-board. This needs to be relocated elsewhere within

                        and others. Turning these switches on singly or in combination will create up 
                        
                        to 8-step sound envelopes, up to five keyboard split points (different sounds 
                        
                        assigned to various key groups), oddly evolving tone clusters and extended decays 
                        
                        lasting up to 30 seconds or more. The multi-step sound envelopes may combine 
                        
                        voices from the SK-1's menu or create new voices, changing voices, strung end-to-end 
                        
                        and finally settling upon an unusual sustained tone, or slowly fading away.

                      </strong>These seven switches and 10K pot make connections between various pins 
                      
                      of the same large IC and a common point on the bottom right-hand side of the 
                      
                      board, that being to a pin on the 14-pin chip just to the left of a board mounting 
                      
                      screw. Again, experiment. Essentially, the five main SKEW switches connect five 
                      
                      pins of the large IC to the smaller IC by running through one of the other two 
                      
                      smaller switches in the group. This signal also passes through the 10K pot. 
                      
                      The pot adjusts the strength of the signal passing between the two chips, and 
                      
                      the smaller push-button and toggle switches allow the choice of either intermittent 
                      
                      or continual use of the chosen SKEW effect while playing. So if, say, SKEW switch 
                      
                      1 is turned on, a connection is made between a pin on the large IC and the pin 
                      
                      on the smaller one. The intensity of the effect is governed with the SKEW pot, 
                      
                      and the musician controls the duration of the effect with the two miniature 
                      
                      actuation switches. The SKEW effects are similar to the IMAGE effects with the 
                      
                      addition of adding pulsings to final voice segments of multi-step sound envelopes. 
                      
                      Assorted sustains, echoes, repeats, doublings, choruses and harmonic distortions 
                      
                      also arise from the SKEW effect group.</font></p>

                      </strong>These three brass balls are wired to three circuit traces just to the 
                      
                      left of the master tuning trim pot soldered into position in the center of the 
                      
                      board. Primarily pitch controls, bridging with a fingertip the gap between the 
                      
                      center sphere and the one to its left will lower the frequency. Bridging the 
                      
                      gap between center and right will raise the frequency. Actually, just touching 
                      
                      either outside sphere will bend the frequency, but not as dramatically as when 
                      
                      bridging the gaps as mentioned. Very nice real-time vibrato and pitch-bend are 
                      
                      possible in this way. Beyond this application, a moistened fingertip pressed 
                      
                      across all three contacts will bring on an assortment of deep-end audio calisthenics 
                      
                      simply impossible to describe! Tech Note: On a crowded circuit board it can 
                      
                      be hard to tell just which traces your fingers are touching to create the audio 
                      
                      changes heard during this process of exploration. Holding a metal jeweler's 
                      
                      screwdriver in each hand will allow you to touch obvious and specific traces 
                      
                      on the board. Electricity will flow into one screwdriver, through your body 
                      
                      and out the other screwdriver back into the circuit. Varying hand pressure on 
                      
                      the screwdrivers will allow you to observe the effect of changing resistance

                      here... experiment! Drastic voice changing in the form of distant ethereal sounds, 
                      
                      rich tonal swells, seemingly chance music cycles, metallic percussive bursts 
                      
                      and endless de-tuned sustains are a few of the effects created by the AXIS GROUP.</font></p>

                      </strong>These two switches represent a choice of "HARD RESET" or 
                      
                      "SOFT RESET". As I've stated before, the unusual anti-theory design 
                      
                      system of circuit-bending can create digital exasperation in logic routines, 
                      
                      otherwise known as program crash. When the circuit-bent SK-1 crashes (and it 
                      
                      will), four reset options are available. Casio's front panel "RESET" 
                      
                      button might work. If not, turning the SK-1's main power switch off and back 
                      
                      on might work. If both of these fail, my "SOFT RESET" miniature push-button 
                      
                      on the left side of the case could solve the problem. This makes the same connection 
                      
                      as IMAGE switch 2. During initial prototyping I noticed that this connection 
                      
                      could reset certain crashes without powering-down the unit. Yes, I could just 
                      
                      flip IMAGE switch 2 on and back off, but the mini push-button is easier, quicker, 
                      
                      and more out of the way while playing. The "HARD RESET" is a "push-on/push-off" 
                      
                      switch situated next to the mini switch just mentioned. This is the deep crash 
                      
                      remedy since it completely breaks the circuit between the power supply and the 
                      
                      board. Therefore, it is also a MASTER POWER switch. This is the standard reset 
                      
                      I include on many circuit-bent instruments prone to crash. Can you keep a secret? 
                      
                      It does the same thing as the tiny reset switch you're instructed to push with 
                      
                      a pencil tip in case of malfunction of your calculator, answering machine, musical 
                      
                      keyboard and lots of other digital whatevers. Yep, the Big Guys' theory-true 
                      
                      toys crash deep enough all by themselves to need as drastic a thing as battery 
                      
                      disconnection to set them straight again too!</font></p>

                      </strong>This group of seven miniature red or green LEDs is implemented by connecting 
                      
                      the anodes (+ leads) of the LEDs to various pins of the large right-hand 28-pin 
                      
                      chip. All LED cathodes (- leads) then connect through a LOGIC PILOTS power switch 
                      
                      (on back of case) to the negative side of the power supply. The switch to turn 
                      
                      them off is needed for two reasons. First, if left on they continue to drain 
                      
                      power unless my added master power switch (HARD RESET) is turned off. Second, 
                      
                      certain IMAGE switches overdrive the LEDs when turned on, risking eventual burnout. 
                      
                      These LEDs flash mysteriously as logic levels (voltages) go high or low as the 
                      
                      instrument functions. These can also be considered STATUS LEDs, and can be quite 
                      
                      informative when gotten used to on this and other circuit-bent instruments. 
                      
                      I've drilled holes for these along the top of the SK-1's case with a few also 
                      
                      mounted below, amidst the control buttons. Circuit connections for these are 
                      
                      discovered the same way as switch connections. Simply use LEDs with alligator 
                      
                      clip test lead extensions in place of the usual short-circuit exploration wire. 
                      
                      Remember that LEDs are polarized semiconductors: if an LED won't light, try 
                      
                      reversing its leads and reconnecting it to the circuit. If an LED glows too 
                      
                      brightly or gets hot, try connecting a resistor (experiment around 100 ohm) 
                      
                      between the LED's anode and the circuit. </font></p>

                      </strong>This clear, bright, red LED (2,000 mcd) is connected across the speaker 
                      
                      terminals and fluctuates with the intensity of the sound without disturbing 
                      
                      sound volume or clarity (which is not always the case with this parallel wiring 
                      
                      scheme). LEDs can also be connected in series with a speaker if more energy 
                      
                      is needed to drive them. Sound envelope LED connection points can also be found 
                      
                      by attaching one LED lead to a speaker terminal and then touching an extension 
                      
                      of the other LED lead to various parts of the active circuit. In fact, such 
                      
                      envelope LEDs can be driven by points discovered on the board having no direct 
                      
                      connection to the speaker whatsoever.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">As noted before, circuit-bending the SK-1 does 
                      
                      require a good deal of careful work since tolerances of both soldering and component 
                      
                      placement are tight. Much more is possible than what I've done. Still, a person 
                      
                      might want to add, say, only a body-contact and leave the rest of the SK-1 untouched.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Any newly bent instrument presenting significant 
                      
                      sound forms deserves a visual transformation as well. Once the holes were drilled 
                      
                      to accept the new switches, pots, LEDs and body-contacts, I painted the case 
                      
                      of my circuit-bent SK-1 a hi-gloss fire engine red. Over that went a flat black 
                      
                      crackle coat. This is a type of paint that contracts and cracks apart as it 
                      
                      dries, leaving an organic-looking and somewhat fractalized pattern. From far 
                      
                      above the case a sweep in the air of holographic micro glitter (several specks 
                      
                      could fit in the dot of this letter i) was rained down onto the housing, falling 
                      
                      like a star field across the scarlet veins in the black crackle field. These 
                      
                      tiny particles reflect a brilliant spectrum of light, shifting hue in unison 
                      
                      as viewing angles change.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">A high-solids clear gloss final coating was then 
                      
                      applied. This deepens colors, serves as a sealant and provides a surface upon 
                      
                      which an extra-fine-tip opaque paint marker can be used to label the new controls, 
                      
                      and re-label the old, their having been painted over in the refinishing process. 
                      
                      New controls are then mounted, unit is reassembled and wiring is begun. With 
                      
                      the SK-1 I decided not to refinish either the case bottom or the strip above 
                      
                      the keys that contains envelope symbols.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Be forewarned that if you decide to dismantle the 
                      
                      entire device to refinish the case as I've done, the keyboard "trees" 
                      
                      need special handling. All the keys, in separate sets for white and black, are 
                      
                      connected to a common tree and remove as single units. It is the junction of 
                      
                      key-to-tree that is very fragile and must be handled with real care. It takes 
                      
                      little force to bend a key out of alignment or snap it off completely.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Exploring the SK-1 circuit is fascinating. In the 
                      
                      EFFECT GROUP discussions above I've only begun to describe the major effects 
                      
                      available within the separate groupings. Not only can each group be depended 
                      
                      upon to produce many more effects than those covered, when multi-group combinations 
                      
                      are experimented with (e.g. IMAGE switches 1,3,7 + SKEW switches 2,3 + AXIS 
                      
                      switch 1 while touching body-contacts or sweeping POLY dial), the surprising 
                      
                      nature of circuit-bending's ability to always generate new audio behavior becomes 
                      
                      evident. My initial examination of such switching combinations produced 30 strong 
                      
                      variations using the PIANO voice alone.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">On some deep-end settings the circuit-bent SK-1 
                      
                      becomes an aleatoric music box, evoking outlandish chance compositions. Other 
                      
                      settings turn the keyboard into an alien sound field generator, intercombining 
                      
                      curtains of relatively pitch-free noises. Peculiar mixtures of countless types 
                      
                      emerge as one moves deeper into switching possibilities... and I now find myself 
                      
                      in the position again of trying to describe the eccentric, many-nuanced voices 
                      
                      of circuit-bending. Like trying to define a rare flavor or shifting color.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">As it often is with circuit-bending, these more 
                      
                      extreme settings impose a control/non-control balance that can take some getting 
                      
                      used to. Program crash is often inevitable under these conditions. Charting 
                      
                      patch settings and sequences goes a long way to establish reliable interactions, 
                      
                      but the temptation to go a step further and see what happens is always there. 
                      
                      I accept, even enjoy the non-control aspects of circuit-bending, feeling that 
                      
                      they add to the mystery, and knowing that they are an integral part of the whole 
                      
                      fascinating process that I've grown to enjoy so much. I'm reminded of the orange 
                      
                      evening light through my wavy glass, and the prismatic fairy-flares dancing 
                      
                      along its crests upon my SK-1 plans as I sat down to begin writing this article.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">I'll admit I thought for a moment of turning on
