  1) Fixed upload/download ratios.  Due to the fact that Turbo Pascal was
     changing data types automatically, therefore inverting numbers to their
     negative equivelent.
  
  2) When starting up, Eternity will now create the directories UNDER the
     temp directory if they don't exist.

  3) Programmed more efficient newscan points, except that they are not JAM
     standard.  You cannot, therefore, use an offline QWK reader or any other
     JAM application that uses newscan pointers.  This should not make a
     difference to almost anyone.
     All NewScan pointers will be lost.  You can delete *.JLR in your MSGS
     directory.

  4) Added the capability to replace strings with files.  To use this feature,
     make the first character of the string into a '%', and then follow that
     directly with the filename.  You can also put a string after the file is
     displayed, by putting a space after the filename and putting your string.

  5) Fixed various bugs within the file flagging routine.

  6) Added the 'K' command for SysOps while reading messages.  You can now
     toggle whether kludge lines will be displayed or not.  By default, it
     will pay attention to what you have set up on that particular message
     base.

  7) Added a feature to the -\ (return from menu) commandkeys.  If you try to
     return to menu and there are no menus on the stack, it will return to the
     fallback menu instead of not doing anything.  When SysOps didn't create
     their menu structures properly, users would sometimes get locked into a
     certain location on the system and have to hang up.

  8) GLOBAL.MNU will not be loaded at the shuttle menu, or any other time when
     a user is not logged on.

  9) Fixed CHECK command at shuttle menu.

 10) Due to a typographical error, the message base editor was not displaying
     the access required to join a message base.
 
 11) You can now create a global conference (a conference that a user may join
     where it ignores conferences) by making the permanent ID -1.
     
 12) There is now a minimum logon speed.  You can change it from the system
     configuration section 'A'.

 13) Fixed quoting.

 14) Fixed many different glitches.
