Impulse 3.5 Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


- Introduction -

Documentation will be short and sweet.  Most things in the BBS Are pretty self
explanatory and won't really be discussed too much.  You can Email me with any
problems or questions regarding Impulse Bugs, Questions and Registration Info
at the following places.

- BBS -          - Internet Email -         - Home Address -
Termite Terrace  nivenh@crl.com             Brandon Sneed
214-288-3211     (specify topic of email)   1423 Valley View Dr.
Nivenh                                      Mesquite, Tx  75149

I can usually be found on most Beta sites as well.  Registration is a mere 20$
which is excellent in reflect of all the support and help you are guaranteed.



- Requirements -

The requirements are the same for just about every other bbs.  Here's some
things that are a MUST for anything.

         o  At least 384k of conventional memory.
         o  EMS/XMS memory for overlays (usage is optional)
         o  A Modem.  2400-115200 bps's are supported.
         o  I recommend at least having 3 megs of HD space free.
            (you cant run off of a floppy drive bub!)

The above is REQUIRED!  There's no way around it, and i'd hope you weren't
trying to setup a bbs without any of them. :)

The following are Recommended by the author.

         o  16550/16550A/166550A1 UART Chip (It makes a BIG Difference)
         o  A modem at least capable of reaching 9600bps.
         o  20 Megs of HD space.  You need room for growth.
         o  EMS/XMS Memory in excess of 2 megs.  The more room you have
            for IMP.OVR in EMS/XMS the faster things will go.
         o  Some sort of Cache.  Whether it be software or hardware, cache
            is ALWAYS beneficial.


- Installation -

Installation is fairly easy, but some people *DO* have problems.  Common probs
are usually having to do with msg/file bases.  These little bugs in the
installation have been fixed since the 2.5 release and the writing of this
documentation.  Simply run INSTALL.EXE from whichever directory you unzipped
this thing in and you're ready to rock.  The install program will guide you
most of the way through things.


- Running for the first time -

Usually when you run your bbs for the first time, you'll probably want to
configure it a little bit.  To load Impulse directly into the config, you're
command line would look like this.

IMP.EXE -S

This will load it in local mode and go directly to the config screen.  First
thing you'll want to do afterwards is get that damn modem configured.  Yes,
i realize this is the most complicated part in the whole bbs. (or is it?).

This is quite simple.  You've got your init string, port and various other
little options which i will leave up to you to decide which / what to use.
One thing before i end this section.  I'm sure you can imagine that COM-0 is
making all output to the modem null.  In other words your modem isn't getting
crap.  This is good for sysop nodes and the such.  Have fun with the
possibilities.



- Making this junk answer the phone -

Hey, you having probs getting the bbs to answer the phone?!?  Well, my first
suggestion would to be to use a mailer, but some people are pretty lazy.  BUT,
rest assured that it will answer the phone so don't come to me complaining and
saying something like "nivenh: your shit won't answer the phone!"  well, #1
you probably are shooting off your mouth before actually taking time to think
about the problem.  First of all, you need your modem in normal response mode
which means it returns things like OK and CARRIER 14400 and such.  None of
this result code junk like 0 and 2.  On my system, i use Intermail .. but to
all of you who won't use IM or FrontDoor, you can play with your init strings.
You must have the S0 register OFF.  If S0 is equal to anything above Zero, the
modem will try and answer when the bbs tries, so you'll just be hanging people
up and that isn't fun. :)



- Modem Specifications -

These are really needed.  As you can guess, i don't have every brand of modem
in the world at my disposal.  If you would be kind enough to give me a copy of
you're modem settings for whichever brand modem you've got you will recieve
the tremendous about of credit you deserve.  I've got a Hayes 14.4 and a Zoom
14.4 myself and those are pretty limited when it comes to the compatibility
of other brands.  If possible, email you're settings to me.  They will be
included in future versions and i'm sure others will like to check and compare
theirs with yours.


- Renegade You say? -

Let me get this clear once and for all.  Impulse is not a souped up RG.  In
fact, its got nothing to do with Renegade BBS whatsoever.  Talk to Cott Lang
if you think i'm lying, but don't come to me and accuse me of ripping off
Renegade because i'm a bit more ethical than that when it comes to code.



- Command Line Parameters -

Command line parameters are important whether your running a system in DV,
OS/2 or under a frontend mailer.  I won't get into super detail on these.  Its
pretty clear by looking.

IMP.EXE [-?, -B, -K, -M, -S, -N, -P, -Q, -X]

    -?       : Shows this junk.
    -B<baud> : Loads impulse at the speed defined in <baud> on the com port
               of the current node.
               ie.  IMP.EXE -B19200
                    IMP.EXE -B11520 (for 115200bps)
    -L       : Local mode.  No output to the modem at all.
    -M<node#>: Loads BBS node specified in <node#>
               ie.  IMP.EXE -B19200 -M1  (this would load node #1 at 19200)
    -Q       : Exit to DOS/OS after next/current user logs off.
               ie.  IMP.EXE -B14400 -M1 -Q (this would load node#1 at 14400
                                             and exit the bbs after logoff)
    -P       : Packs EMAIL and MESSAGE bases and exits.  Useful as a nightly
               event.
    -X<time> : Exits at specified time to run an external event.
               NOTE: Specified time MUST be in military format.  ie 24:00 and
                     such.
               ie.  IMP.EXE -X00:01  (exit for event at 12:01 midnight)



- Menu Commands/Setup -

Ahh, my favorite part.  Yeah right.. this is gonna take forever.  A few
little notes.  FIRSTCMD as a key executes that command everytime the menu
is first loaded.  ENTER as a key is the same as the user pressing ENTER.
This is useful for people who like rg's way to do pulldowns. (don't ask me
why, but people do.)

- Impulse MCI/Pipe/Percent Codes -

All MCI Codes are the same in strings and ansi/rip/avt files.  String Codes
will be preceeded by | and ansi/rip/avt files will be preceeded by %.

UN - User Handle        TT - Daily Time Limit       PA - Pause Screen

DK - Downloaded K       DT - Date                            colors 1 to 9
UP - Uploads            TM - Time                   B0..B7 - Background Colors
DN - Downloads          PC - Post/Call Ratio                 0 to 7.
PS - Posts              NR - U/D Ratio
CS - Calls              KR - U/D K Ratio            All String MCI's will work
TL - Time Left          LD - Last on Date           with any standard ANSI
NF - New Files          CF - Current File Area      file unless otherwise
NP - New Posts          CM - Current Msg Base       specified in documentation.

The |XY and %XY Codes are a bit different than the rest.  The X and Y position
must follow directly after the |XY/%XY codes.  The positions following must be
in a 4 character set.  For example: "|XY0305" would go to XY 3,5.  3,5 being
positions on the screen within the 80x25 limits.  Another would be: %XY1215.
The "%XY1215" would goto XY 12,15 on the ansi currently occupying the screen.

This file can be read from an external program and used to pass parameters
without parsing the command line and providing more information that other-
wise available for an external program without reading data files which can
be a hassle.  Look for IMP35DEV.ZIP which is the official Impulse Development
kit for version 3.5.  This ZIP has been updated since v3.0.


- ISL For Dummies -

ISL short for Impulse Script Language (original eh?).  Lets get a few things
down before i start to make things easier for the both of us.  A script
may reside in ANY directory you want.  Simply enter the path along with the
script filename in the CString, OR you could just enter the script filename
in there to use the impulse directory.  Anyway, here's a few things you'll
be seeing throughout the rest of this section.

--- System Variables

            number.


--- Condition variables

            These variable are set on some occasion by the interpreter,
            when it meets some special commands. They often are the result
            of an operation.


            COMPARE

Details     The COMPARE variable is created by the COMPARE and INSTR
            commands, and is used by the IF command. With COMPARE, it can
            have the values of "=" (equal), "<" (smaller) or ">" (greater).
            With INSTR you can find "=" (found) or "<" (not found). This
            variable is internally checked by the IF command.

See also    COMPARE, INSTR, IF.


            DOSERR

Details     The DOSERR variable contains the number of the last DOS error
            that occured. Refer to the appendix for DOS errors list.


            EL

Details     The EL variable contains the return code ("errorlevel") of the 
            last DEXEC call.

See also    DEXEC.


            FEOF

Details     The FEOF variable contains the label to go when end of file
            is reached, as set by the FROPEN command.

See also    FREAD, FROPEN.



            INSTR

Details     The INSTR variable contains the position of the substring found
            in the last call of the INSTR command.

See also    INSTR.


            IOERR

Details     The IOERR command contains the last I/O error that occured. 
            Refer to the appendix for the list of I/O errors.


            SCAN

Details     The SCAN variable contains the scan code -if any- obtained from
            the last READKEY call. Scan codes are listed in appendix.

See also    READKEY


--- User-defined variables

            These variables are there for you to define, using the SET
            command. The influence the way some commands work.


            AMP

Details     The AMP variable is set to nothing or anything. If it is set to 
            something, then user will be able to use the ampersand
            character (&) when entering input with ASK, POPASK or READKEY.
            Also if it is set to something, ampersands won't be removed
            using the FREAD command.

See also    ASK, FREAD, POPASK, READKEY.


            MASK

Details     The MASK variable is used with ASK and POPASK. When MASK is
            different from a blank string, all input entered by user will
            echo its contents. For example, for password-entering, SETting
            MASK to "*" would be very interesting.

See also    ASK, POPASK

--- General Commands

            This is the list of the commands supported by the ISL
            language. They are listed in alphabetical order, and this
            reference text explains everything about these commands.


            ARG

Syntax      ARG <variable> <number> <text>

Details     The ARG command will put the (<number>+1)th argument in the
            <text> string in the specified <variable>. Notice that you must
            use the CMD command to get the first argument.

Example     ask fullname 7 1 30 What's your full name?
            cmd firstname &fullname&
            arg lastname 1 &fullname&
            write So your first name is &firstname&
            write and your last name is &lastname&.

See also    ARGLINE, CMD


            ARGLINE

Syntax      ARGLINE <variable> <number> <text>

Details     The ARGLINE command will put the (<number>+1)th argument, and
            all the rest of the <text> string in the specified <variable>.

Example     set fulldata John Wells 780 Pine St. HomeTown USA
            argline address 2 &fulldata&
            write Address is &address&.

See also    ARG, CMD


            ASK

Syntax      ASK <variable> <foreground> <background> <length> [<question>]

Details     The ASK command puts an user input in the specified <variable>.
            You must set the <foreground> and <background> colors, and the
            <lenght> of the input field. Also you can specify a <question>
            that will be written before the input field.

            Notice that if the <variable> is not empty, its contents will
            become the default string.

Example     ask name 7 1 30 Write your name:
            write Hello &name&!

See also    READKEY


            BACK

Syntax      BACK <background>

Details     The BACK command sets the <background> color. The valid color
            numbers are listed in the appendix.

Example     back 1
            cls
            write Now I'm writing on a blue background!

See also    FORE, GETBACK, GETFORE


            BREAK

Details     The BREAK command will enable or disable the Ctrl-Break
            checking.


            CD

Syntax      CD <directory>

Details     The CD command changes the current <directory>. Errors are
            reported via the IOERR variable.

Example     cd c:\temp
            compare &ioerr& 0
            if = skip1
            md c:\temp
            cd c:\temp
            :skip1

See also    GETDIR, MD, RD


            CENTER

Syntax      CENTER <text>

Details     The CENTER command centers a <text> on the screen, according to
            the current window coordinates, and then moves the cursor to
            the next line.

See also    SCENTER, SWRITE, WRITE


            CHAIN

Syntax      CHAIN <filename>

Details     The CHAIN command allows to chain to an other .ISL program. The
            execution begins at the specified <label>, or if none
            specified, at the beginning of the file.

            A good practice when calling another program is to set the
            CHFILE variable to the current program's filename (Obtained
            with the PARAM command) and the CHLABEL variable to a label to
            goto when execution is finished. Please always use these
            standards when creating "sub-programs" to be called from a main
            program!

Example     param chfile 1
            set chlabel ret1
            chain prog2
            :ret1

See also    GOSUB, GOTO


            CHR

Syntax      CHR <variable> <number>

Details     The CHR command puts the ASCII code of the specified <number>
            in the <variable>.

Example     ask num 7 1 3 Write an ASCII code (0-255):
            chr char &num&
            write The associated ASCII character is "&char&".


            CJUST

Syntax      CJUST <variable> <length>

Details     The CJUST command center-justifies the string contained in the
            <variable>, for a specific <length>. It fills the unoccupied
            spaces with space characters. (ASCII #32)

See also    LJUST, RJUST


            CLEOL

Syntax      CLEOL

Details     The CLEOL command clears the current line from the current
            cursor position to the end of the line, using the current

            coordinates.

See also    CLS


            CLS

Syntax      CLS

Details     The CLS command clears the entire window (Or the screen if no
            window defined) using the current background color.

See also    CLEOL


            CLSTACK

Syntax      CLSTACK

Details     The CLSTACK command clears the current stack used by GOSUB,
            POP, PUSH and RETURN, as many POP command would do.

See also    GOSUB, POP, PUSH, RETURN


            CLTRAP

Syntax      CLTRAP

Details     The CLTRAP command clears all key trap definitions.

See also    TRAP, TRAPESC


            CMD

Syntax      CMD <variable> <text>

Details     The CMD command will put the first argument in the <text>
            string in the specified <variable>. Notice that you must
            use the ARG command to get the other arguments.

Example     ask fullname 7 1 30 What's your full name?
            cmd firstname &fullname&
            arg lastname 1 &fullname&
            write So your first name is &firstname&
            write and your last name is &lastname&.

See also    ARG, ARGLINE


            COLORS

Syntax      COLORS <border> <text> <high> <bar>

Details     The COLORS command sets the <border>, <text>, <high> and <bar> 
            colors used in the POPxxx and HELP commands. Notice that each
            argument is separated in 2, the foreground and the background! 
            The colors are listed in the appendix.

Example     colors 9 1 7 1 14 1 0 7
            popask tmp 0 7 30 What's your name?

See also    HELP, POPASK, POPMENU, POPMSG, POPSUB, POPWIN


            COMPARE

Syntax      COMPARE <string1> <string2>

Details     The COMPARE command is used with IF to branch execution 
            depending on a comparison of two strings. This command sets the 
            COMPARE variable to "=", "<" or ">", depending if <string1> is
            respectively equal to, smaller than or greater than <string2>.
            Then the IF command checks this variable also.

Example     ask num 7 1 3 Write a number:
            compare &num& 10
            if < skip1
            if = skip2
            write &num& is greater than 10.
            end
            :skip1
            write &num& is smaller than 10.
            end
            :skip2
            write &num& is equal to 10.

See also    IF, IFEXIST, IFNUM, INSTR


            COPYVAR

Syntax      COPYVAR <source variable> <target variable>

Details     The COPYVAR commands acts a little like the SET command, but it 
            only accepts variable names as parameters (Even the <source>.)
            Its main purpose is when working with indexes. In the example
            shown, you will see how to display the variable "tmp1" to 
            "tmp10" easily, using COPYVAR.

Example     set count 0
            :loop
            inc count
            copyvar tmp&count& toshow
            write &toshow&
            compare &count& 10
            if <= loop

See also    SET


            CTRLSTR

Syntax      CTRLSTR <variable>

Details     The CTRLSTR command changes the specified <variable> contents
            the following way: when it encounters control characters (ASCII
            characters 0 to 31), it replaces them by a string of the
            "[#<ASCII code>]" format. Notice that the same procedure is
            internally used when you use the SHOWVAR command.


            CUT

Syntax      CUT <variable> <index> <length> <source>

Details     The CUT command puts a "cut" of a certain <length>, beginning
            with the <index>th character from the <source> string, and put 
            it into the <variable>. It can be used along with INSTR to 
            detect if a string exists in another string, and then take 
            them.

Example     ask tmp 0 7 20 Write text:
            cut tmp2 1 2 &tmp&
            write The first two characters of &tmp&
            write are &tmp2&


            DEC

Syntax      DEC <variable> [<count>]

Details     The DEC command decrements the numeric <variable> by 1, or by
            the <count>, if specified.

Example     write Beginning countdown...
            set count 11
            :loop
            dec count
            swrite &count&...
            compare &count& 0
            if > loop
            write Lift Off!

See also    DIV, INC, MULT


            DELAY

Syntax      DELAY <milliseconds>

Details     The DELAY command will wait the specified number of
            <milliseconds> before continuing. To get a one-second pause,
            use DELAY 1000.


            DELLINE

Syntax      DELLINE

Details     The DELLINE command deletes the current screen row, so that all 
            rows under that one scroll up, according to the current window
            coordinates.

See also    INSLINE


            DEXEC

Syntax      DEXEC <full path> [<parameters>]

Details     The DEXEC command will directly load a program and execute it, 
            without using COMMAND.COM. However, to do this, you need to 
            specify the <full path> (Directory, file, extension.) One or
            more <parameters> can be specified. Error codes (Errorlevels)
            are returned via the EL variable, and DOS errors are returned 
            in DOSERR.

            DEXEC cannot be used with DOS commands (DIR, COPY, etc.) and 
            batch files.

Example     dexec C:\ZDIR\PROG.EXE
            write DOS error &doserr& and Error code &el&.

See also    EXEC


            DIV

Syntax      DIV <variable> <factor>

Details     The DIV command divides the <variable> contents by a specified 
            <factor>. If the <factor> is 0, then a "Division by zero" error 
            will occur. The result of the division is put in the 
            <variable>.

See also    DEC, INC, MULT


            END

Syntax      END

Details     The END command terminates the program.

See also    ERROR


            ERROR

Syntax      ERROR <text>

Details     The ERROR command terminates the program and the interpreter
            generates an error, writing "<text> on line <l>", where <l> is 
            the number of the line where you called this command.

See also    END


            EXEC

Syntax      EXEC <dos command>

Details     The EXEC command loads the command interpreter (COMMAND.COM in 
            most cases) with the "/C" switch and tells it to execute the
            <dos command>. Error codes cannot be trapped using EXEC: use
            DEXEC instead. DOS errors are reported via the DOSERR variable.

Example     exec DIR /P

See also    DEXEC


            EXPAND

Syntax      EXPAND <variable>

Details     The EXPAND command expands the <variable> to a full pathname.
            For example, do "expand fn" in the directory C:\ZDIR\TEMP, 
            with the variable "fn" containing "..\abc.txt", and that 
            variable will now be equal to "C:\ZDIR\ABC.TXT". This command 
            puts the string in upper case.

See also    SPLIT


            FORE

Syntax      FORE <foreground>

            FREAD

Syntax      FREAD <variable>

Details     The FREAD command reads a line in the current input file. 
            Notice that the input file must have been opened. If end of
            file is encountered, control is automatically given to the
            label defined with FROPEN. Errors are reported via the IOERR
            variable.

Example     fropen test.doc l1
            :l2
            fread tmp
            goto l2
            :l1

            GOSUB

Syntax      GOSUB <label>

Details     The GOSUB command pushes the current line number in the stack,
            and then transfers control to the <label>. To return from a
            GOSUB, just use the RETURN command. Look at the example below
            for better understanding.

            GOSUB is ideal for creating subprograms and procedures.

Example     write In main program, Calling label1
            gosub label1
            write Returned to main program
            end
            :label1
            write In label1, Calling label2
            gosub label2
            write In label1, Returning to main program
            return
            :label2
            write In label2, Returning to label1
            return

Test run    In main program, Calling label1
            In label1, Calling label2
            In label2, Returning to label1
            In label1, Returning to main program
            Returned to main program

            HELP

Syntax      HELP <topic>

Details     The HELP command activates the online help system. To use it,
            you must have set the HELPFILE variable to the help file full 
            pathname. Help files have this format:

                {<topic>}
                    <text...
                    ...text>
                {<other topic>}
                    <text...
                    ...text>

            In the help <text>, words between curly braces ({}) will be 
            highlighted, and if the user points on them and presses Enter, 
            the help system will call this as another topic.

            The help window colors are defined with the COLORS command.

Example     set helpfile PROG.HLP
            trap 59 namehelp
            write Press F1 for help!
            push

            pop
            write Hello, &name&!
            end
            :namehelp
            pop
            help entername
            return


            HIBACK

Syntax      HIBACK {ON|OFF}

Details     The HIBACK command enables or disables te high background 
            option. If set to ON, background colors higher than 7 will be 
            supported, otherwise they'll produce blinking color.


            IF

Syntax      IF <symbol> <label if true> [<label if false>]

Details     The IF command will only work when preceded by a COMPARE or
            INSTR command. IF first checks if the <symbol> works with the 
            comparison (if the contents of the COMPARE variable are found 
            in the <symbol> argument), and if it workd, if goes to the 
            <label if true>. Otherwise, it goes to the <label if false>, or
            to the next line if not specified.

            The <symbols> you can use are the following:

            =   Str1 is equal to Str2           Str1 is in Str2
            <   Str1 is smaller than Str2       Str1 isn't in Str2
            >   Str1 is greater than Str2
            <=  Str1 is smaller than or equal to Str2
            >=  Str1 is greater than or equal to Str2
            <>  Str1 is different from Str2     Str1 isn't in Str2

Example     write Type "C" to continue or "Q" to quit
            :loop
            readkey key
            upcase key
            compare &key& C
            if = cont
            compare &key& Q
            if = quit loop
            :cont
            write Continuing...
            end
            :quit
            write Thanks for using this program!

            IFEXIST

Syntax      IFEXIST <filename> <label if true> [<label if false>]

Details     The IFEXIST command first checks if the <filename> exists in
            the current directory or the DOS path. If it does, it then
            branches to the <label if true>, and if it does not, it goes to
            the <label if false>, or the next line if none specified.

Example     ifexist TEST.DOC yes
            write TEST.DOC doesn't exists!
            end
            :yes
            write TEST.DOC found!

            IFNUM

Syntax      IFNUM <value> <label if true> [<label if false>]

Details     The IFNUM command checks if the <value> given is a real number.
            Then, if it is, it branches to the <label if true>; otherwise
            it branches to the <label if false>, or the next line if none
            specified.

See also    IF


            INC

Syntax      INC <variable> [<count>]

Details     The INC command increments the <variable> by 1, or by the
            <count>, if specified.

Example     write Counting from 1 to 10...
            set count 0
            :loop
            inc count
            swrite &count&,
            compare &count& 10
            if < loop

            INSLINE

Syntax      INSLINE

Details     The INSLINE command inserts a line at the current screen row, 
            so that all rows under that one scroll down, according to the 
            current window coordinates.

See also    DELLINE


            INSTR

Syntax      INSTR <substring> <string>

Details     The INSTR command checks if the <substring> is found in the
            <string>. Then it sets the COMPARE variable to one of these two
            values:

            =   <substring> is found in <string>
            <   <substring> isn't found in <string>

            INSTR also sets the INSTR variable, which contains the posision 
            in <string> where the <substring> was found. (The posision 1
            corresponds to the first character.) If <substring> wasn't
            found, then the INSTR variable is set to 0.

            Use the IF command to branch execution depending on the
            found/not found statre of the COMPARE variable.

Example     :loop
            write Type 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5.
            readkey number
            instr &number& 12345
            if < loop
            write You typed &number&!

Details     The LJUST command left-justifies the string contained in the 
            <variable>, for a specific <length>. It fills the unoccupied 
            spaces with space characters. (ASCII #32)

See also    CJUST, RJUST


            LOCATE

Syntax      LOCATE <column> <row>

            POP

Syntax      POP

Details     The POP command pops the upper line number from the stack, as
            the RETURN command does, but without returning. It is mostly
            used when in a TRAP gosub call.

Example     write Main program, calling Sub...
            gosub sub
            write Returned to Main program
            end

            PUSH can be used to "create" a GOSUB case, in a menu for
            example.

Example     push
            popsub 3 DOS Operations
                item 1 copy C Copy file
                item 2 rename R Rename file

Details     The RANDOM command will put a random number between 0 and 
            (<value>-1) in the <variable>. Always use RANDOMIZE before to
            set the ransom seed generator on the system clock!

Example     randomize
            random number 40
            set tries 1
            set msg< Too small!
            set msg> Too big!
            write I chose a number between 0 to 39...

            RANDOMIZE

Syntax      RANDOMIZE

Details     The RANDOMIZE command initializes the random number generator
            on the system timer. You should always call this command once
            in a program that uses RANDOM, or the same values will always
            be returned.

Syntax      READKEY <variable>

Details     The READKEY command reads a key from the keyboard and puts it 
            into the <variable>. If this key is the NUL character (ASCII 
            character #0) then READKEY reads the next key in the buffer; 
            this is a scan code. Scan codes are put in the SCAN variable;
            they're used to detect Alt-keys, FKeys, Arrows, etc. They are
            listed in the appendix.

Example     readkey key
            compare &key& &null&

            SPLIT

Syntax      SPLIT <variable>

Details     The SPLIT command separates a <variable>, containing a 
            filename, into its three components: path, name and extension.
            The path is put in the SPLDIR variable, the name is put in 
            SPLNAME and the extension in SPLEXT. It is a good idea to
            EXPAND the filename before using SPLIT.

            Notice that if you did "split var" then
            "&spldir&&splname&&splext&" is equal to "&var&".

            TRAP

Syntax      TRAP <scan code> [<label>]

Details     The TRAP command sets keys that will be trapped in ASK, POPxxx
            and READKEY calls. Up to 10 <scan codes> can be defined, and
            the <label> is the one to GOSUB if this key is hit. If the
            <label> is not specified, then the scan code is removed from
            memory and won't be trapped anymore.

            This command only works with scan codes. To use the Esc key,
            use the TRAPESC command. To clear all scan codes, use CLTRAP.

            Scan codes are listed in appendix.

Example     trap 49 altn
            write Type Alt-N to write "New".
            ask name 0 7 30 Logon>

- Infoform System -

Due to the limited abilities and lack of knowledge on how to use animation by
some people, the impulse Infoform system has been re-written.  Now, the
standard * is still being used, but |XX can be used in its place.  Too use |XX
just enter it as you would in any other infoform system, and XX is represeting
the number of spaces to use for input.

EXAMPLE:

    Enter your current Age: |03

The above would allow the user 3 spaces to enter his age.  Even if he only
uses 2 (unless he's over 99 yrs old) everything works out great.  For new users
the infoform filename used in the NUV is NEWUSER.INF.  Same as renegade,
although it may be changed for that very reason in the future.


- Multitasking under OS/2 -

Nowaday's it seems everyone needs multitasking.  Why you ask?  I reply with
"Wake up and smell the brew idiot!".  I realize and acutally make use of the
power of multitasking.  Half of the time i'm coding in the background while
someone is leeching my board (Termite Terrace).  So, just to keep up with
oblivion/spew here's *MY* settings and recommendations for runing under OS/2.

Here's the basic settings you'll need for OS/2.  Keep in mind, some of these
you can modify to your hearts content, this is just what *I* think works best
so feel free to experiment and modify them.  One thing that you ABSOLUTELY
need is Ray Gwinn's SIO Drivers.  They can ben found in SIOXXXX.ZIP  .. XXXX
representing the version number.  Currently i'm using 1.15 reg'd so find it
if possible on any spiffolah board.

Settings for the DOS Session that runs D'Bridge and Impulse under OS/2:

DOS_AUTOEXEC=C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT   (See #1 below)
DOS_BACKGROUND_EXECUTION=ON
DOS_BREAK=ON
DOS_DEVICE=C:\OS2\MDOS\VX00.SYS  (Loads the FOSSIL only in this session.)
DOS_FCBS=16
DOS_FCBS_KEEP=8
DOS_FILES=30
DOS_HIGH=ON
DOS_LASTDRIVE=Z
DOS_RMSIZE=640
DOS_SHELL=C:\OS2\MDOS\COMMAND.COM C:\OS2\MDOS
DOS_STARTUP_DRIVE=
DOS_UMB=OFF
DOS_VERSION=  (LEAVE THIS ALONE)
DPMI_DOS_API=AUTO
DPMI_MEMORY_LIMIT=4
DPMI_NETWORK_BUFF_SIZE=8
EMS_FRAME_LOCATION=AUTO
EMS_HIGH_OS_MAP_REGION=32
EMS_LOW_OS_MAP_REGION=384
EMS_MEMORY_LIMIT=2048
HW_NOSOUND=OFF
HW_ROM_TO_RAM=OFF
HW_TIMER=OFF
IDLE_SECONDS=0
IDLE_SENSITIVITY=75

Topical lines from my CONFIG.SYS:

IFS=C:\OS2\HPFS.IFS  /CACHE:1024 /CRECL:4 /AUTOCHECK:CDEFGHILKMJN
  I use only HPFS partitions.  With all the usage the BBS has, messages 
  and such, I have never seen more than 2% fragmentation.  Also, it has
  saved me lots of space (FAT cluster sizes are too big on large 
  partitions), and has proven to be very fast.

SET AUTOSTART=PROGRAMS,TASKLIST,FOLDERS,CONNECTIONS
  This is stock, but is worth mentioning because it is what restarts 
  your sessions if the system reboots for any reason.  HPFS partitions 
  will automatically have Diskfix run on them if it was not a planned 
  shutdown.

PRIORITY_DISK_IO=YES
  This gives the session in the foreground priority on disk accesses.
  You may want to set this to off if you find any comm errors while the
  BBS is in the background.  I can have a 14.4 caller, have my own 14.4 
  session doing a transfer, and run Describe, or whatever in the 
  foreground.  Both comm sessions still get a 1600+ CPS rate.

MAXWAIT=3
  This is how long a program must wait (maximum) before being given 
  priority for running (getting a timeslice).  See MAXWAIT in the 
  Command Reference.

DEVICE=C:\OS2\SIO.SYS (COM3:38400)
  This loads the SIO comm driver.  The COM3:38400 locks that port at 38400.

REM SET DELDIR=C:\DELETE,512;D:\DELETE,512;E:\DELETE,512;....thru N
  I found that the Delete protection was a bit slow when running a BBS.
  If I did not protect the BBS partitions, why bother?  So, I shut it
  down.  Of course, taking the line (and any REM'd line) out will speed
  the booting process.

#1- AUTOEXEC.BAT

@ECHO OFF
ECHO.
PROMPT $i$p$g
PATH C:\OS2;C:\OS2\MDOS;C:\;
LOADHIGH APPEND C:\OS2;C:\OS2\SYSTEM
SET TEMP=C:\OS2\MDOS\TEMP

  I put most all the setting for anything associated with the BBS into
  the standard AUTOEXEC.BAT.  I can run any utility from another DOS
  session, and I know that any environment variables are set correctly.
  However, in my BAT file that runs D'B and the BBS, I do have to set
  things like the DSZ port and DSZ log.  I do not want them the same for
  all sessions.  I use a different BAT in the AUTOEXEC setting for other
  comm programs so I can control what they use and do.  Pretty nice!

#2- I do not load any drivers high, so don't need the UMBs active.

#3- I had a utility that did not have enough EMS pages free.  Setting
    this to 32 gave it the room it needed.

NOTE:  Much credit for this section goes out to Gary Hammer.  His Textfiles
       on running a bbs under os/2 helped me TREMENDOUSLY in setting up my
       own.  Thanks Gary.. (if by some chance in hell you see this).


- Ending Statements -

These docs are very limited.  I encourage you to play with all the options as
i don't have the time or patients to go through them ALL for you.  I do have
to program you know. :)  If you have questions regarding impulse or problems
refer to the section called "Introduction" for email addresses and such.  I
realize that this may not help much, but hey.. you've gotta do some things on
your own.  Thank you VERY much for your time spent with Impulse BBS and any
thing you may do to help in the future.
